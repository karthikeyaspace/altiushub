Creating django app

- start env
- pip install django
- django-admin startproject ecommerce .
- python manage.py runserver
- python manage.py startapp api
- create urls.py in api folder and add necessary urls
- create a view and link it to url route

- create models and do
  - python manage.py makemigrations
  - python manage.py migrate

Note: Django sets up a default middleware that looks for CSRF token (cross site request forgery token), it generated by server and it helps to prevent unauthorized requests from attackers.
So if you are making a post request you need to provide `X-CSRFToken` in the request header.

We can add @csrf_exempt decorator on top of a view..
Check the endpoint get-csrf-token.
